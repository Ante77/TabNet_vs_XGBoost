This repository contains a short paper "Comparing deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches for tabular data: TabNet vs XGBoost" that was made as a continuation on my Ericsson Nikola Tesla Summer Camp 2022 internship.

The paper was later awarded first place at the competition "Ericsson Nikola Tesla best student work in the field of Telecommunications" for students of FER, Zagreb. It was made in collaboration with Karla Kijac (FER).

Source code will be added to the repository some time in the future.
